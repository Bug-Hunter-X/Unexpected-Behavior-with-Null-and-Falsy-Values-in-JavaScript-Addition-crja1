# Unexpected Behavior with Null and Falsy Values in JavaScript Addition

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript when performing addition with null or undefined values, and other falsy values like 0 or empty strings. The original code handles null values correctly, but it doesn't explicitly handle other falsy values. This can lead to unexpected results.

The `bug.js` file contains the code with the error, while the `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that addresses the issue by using strict equality checks and handling other falsy values.
